# Introduction

Modern applications are complex and take many different forms: Web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, CLI apps, other APIs, Bots, IoT apps, and so on. In this blog post we discuss what it takes for your API to let any app communicate with it securely via the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols.

By utilizing these standards, you can have a single Identity Provider protecting all of your apps. Allowing your users to sign into all of your apps using the same account, providing a seamless SSO (Single Sign On and Single Sign Out) experience. Another great benefit is you can easily allow 3rd party apps to connect to your APIs without compromising security.
