To get a dump of a database you can use `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall` for dumping an entire cluster. It [supports 4 formats](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-pgdump.html):

| Format      | Description                                                  | Restore via  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `plain`     | Output a plain-text SQL script file (the default).           | `psql`       |
| `custom`    | Output a custom-format archive suitable for input into pg_restore. Together with the directory output format, this is the most flexible output format in that it allows manual selection and reordering of archived items during restore. This format is also compressed by default. | `pg_restore` |
| `directory` | Output a directory-format archive suitable for input into pg_restore. This will create a directory with one file for each table and blob being dumped, plus a so-called Table of Contents file describing the dumped objects in a machine-readable format that pg_restore can read. A directory format archive can be manipulated with standard Unix tools; for example, files in an uncompressed archive can be compressed with the gzip tool. This format is compressed by default. | `pg_restore` |
| `tar`       | Output a `tar`-format archive suitable for input into pg_restore. The tar format is compatible with the directory format: extracting a tar-format archive produces a valid directory-format archive. However, the tar format does not support compression. Also, when using tar format the relative order of table data items cannot be changed during restore. | `pg_restore` |

### How to backup a database

To create a dump of `sample-db` in `custom` format and save it to `sample-db.dump`:

```bash
pg_dump -U postgres --encoding utf8 -F c -f sample-db.dump sample-db
```

To create a dump of `sample-db` in `plain` format and save it to `sample-db.sql`:
```bash
pg_dump -U postgres --encoding utf8 -F p -f stoplist.sql stoplist
```
### How to restore a database dump

First create an empty database to restore the dump to.

```bash
# We use template0 is empty and it doesn't conflict with the schemas and tables in the dump.
createdb -U postgres restored-db --template=template0
```

Restore `custom`, `directory`, and `tar` format dumps using `pg_restore`:

```bash
pg_restore -U postgres -d restored-db < ./sample-db.dump
```

Restore `plain` format dumps using `psql`:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d restored-db < ./sample-db.sql
```

> **Note:** In Powershell the `<` operator doesn't work. So you'll have to use `cmd` on Windows.

### Errors you might come across:

1. Currupted dumps
```
pg_restore: [archiver] found unexpected block id (x) when reading data -- expected y
```

```
pg_restore: error unrecognized data block type
```

This might mean the dump is corrupted. One possible reason is the database contained Unicode data and the dump was not encoded in utf8. Use `--encoding utf8` when running `pg_dump` to fix that.

2. Restoring `plain` format dumps using `pg_restore`:
```
pg_restore: [archiver] did not find magic string in file header
```

```
pg_restore: [archiver] input file does not appear to be a valid archive
```

This happens if you run `pg_restore` on a `plain` format dump. Use `psql` to restore it instead.
