    I am a Software engineer from Kurdistan, Iraq. I have been programming since I was 13, building little programs using Multimedia builder and then trying out VB6. I then learned VB.NET and used it for a while. I mainly use C# now and I have experience in building desktop, mobile and web applications using ASP.NET Core, WPF, UWP, and Xamarin Forms. I am a Microsoft Certified Professional in C# and a Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate in UWP. And I also â™¥ Open Source!

 I have been writing about programming for a few years now, although most of my older articles were in Kurdish. You can find them <a href="http://devstree.io/author/muhammad">here</a>. I also try to contribute to Wikipedia as much as I can.
