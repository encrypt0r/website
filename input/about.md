Title: About Me
---
I am a Software engineer from Kurdistan, Iraq. I have been programming since I was 13, building little programs using Multimedia builder and then trying out VB6. I then learned VB.NET and used it for a while. I mainly use C# now and I have experience in building desktop, mobile and web applications using ASP.NET Core, WPF, UWP, and Xamarin Forms. I am a Microsoft Certified Professional in C# and a Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate in UWP.
