I love working on side projects that help me learn about new things and experiment new technologies. Here are some of my projects:

## Kurdspell
A spellchecking library for morphologically complex languages.

## Permadelete
A beautiful file shredder for Windows that has been downloaded more than 50,000 times.

## LoxSharp
A little interpreter for the Lox programming language written in C#. To make sure itâ€™s easy for people to try it out, I created a user interface for it in Blazor which runs on Web Assembly that allows the interpreter to run in the browser without needing a backend.
